## Self introduction

Good morning/afternoon,

My name is Eric, and I am an chemist with a Master's degree in Applied Chemistry from East China University of Science and Technology. I currently hold the position of Assistant Lab Manager & Senior Formulation Chemist at BASF.

My expertise lies in both organic and physical chemistry, and my day-to-day responsibilities are diverse. I am responsible for the routine maintenance of laboratory equipment, ensuring the smooth running of lab operations, and complying with all safety protocols. These tasks not only keep the laboratory in optimal working condition but also ensure the safety of all personnel.

One of my significant achievements at BASF is my contribution to the development of a surfactant HLD parameter library. Collaborating with teams in North America and Germany, I played a crucial role in establishing a high-throughput method that analyzed over 3500 samples and determined HLD parameters for 54 surfactants. This initiative accelerated product development, benefited multiple projects, and laid the groundwork for a database that will assist future work.

Additionally, I have been instrumental in reducing material consumption through the development of high-throughput digital workflows for emulsion and defoamer screening. Having tested over 3000 formulations and built a comprehensive database, my efforts have resulted in more efficient processes, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.

A recent project that I am particularly proud of is predicting perfume capsule stability. By designing 15 DOE formulas, I managed to shorten the project timeline to a mere two weeks, culminating in the successful launch of a new product.

My previous work experience includes positions as a Makeup Researcher at Cosmax, where I developed and scaled up various makeup products, and a Process R&D Researcher at WuXi AppTec, where I designed, screened, and scaled up drug synthesis routes.

Apart from my technical skills in chemistry, I am proficient in Python and data analysis. I often utilize high-throughput screening devices to quickly sift through numerous formulations to find the right match. Balancing my work as a Senior Chemist and transitioning into the role of Assistant Manager, I am also learning the ropes of managing projects and teams.

In my personal life, I reside in Shanghai and enjoy following football, with Manchester United being my favorite team. I strive to maintain a work-life balance, despite the challenges of being a father to a four-year-old daughter and navigating a transitional period in my career.

I believe my blend of technical expertise and leadership potential make me a valuable asset. I am committed to continual learning and looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your organization.

Thank you for considering my application.

## Q&A
### 你在之前的工作中最自豪的成就是什么？

In my previous role at BASF, the achievement I'm most proud of is my significant contribution to the development of a surfactant HLD parameter library. Collaborating with teams across continents, I established a high-throughput method that determined HLD parameters for 54 surfactants and analyzed over 3500 samples. This effort not only accelerated product development, benefiting two specific projects but also laid the foundation for a database that will assist in future work. The global collaboration and the positive impact on our development process make this my proudest accomplishment.

在我在巴斯夫的工作中，我最自豪的成就是在开发表面活性剂HLD参数库方面的重要贡献。通过与多个大洲的团队合作，我建立了一种高通量方法，为54种表面活性剂确定了HLD参数，并分析了超过3500个样本。这一努力不仅加速了产品开发，使两个具体项目受益，而且为将来的工作奠定了数据库的基础。全球合作和对我们的开发过程的积极影响使这成为我最自豪的成就。



### 你如何解决困难和挑战？请举一个实际例子。


One of the practical examples of solving difficulties and challenges occurred when I was conducting an experiment, and feedback from our North American team revealed a mismatch in many data points. We thoroughly investigated various potential causes, including the purity of the materials we were using, the pH and hardness of the water, and the accuracy of the density of different saline solutions. Ultimately, we discovered a minor leak in one of the steel needles of the sampling device used for liquid addition, causing the salt concentration to become unstable. The accuracy of the sample addition was crucial to this part of the experiment. 

Once we identified the problem, we contacted the instrument manufacturer for recalibration and maintenance. We also communicated the specific issue to our North American colleagues, checked the relevant experiments, and repeated any data involving this steel needle or where uncertainty existed. This solution corrected the data error and ensured the accuracy of the experiment.

在我进行一个实验时，出现了一个解决困难和挑战的实际例子。北美团队的反馈显示，许多数据点不匹配。我们彻底调查了各种可能的原因，包括我们使用的原料的纯度，水的pH和硬度，以及不同盐水的密度的准确性。最终，我们发现用于液体加样的点样设备的两根钢针之一有轻微泄漏，导致盐度变得不稳定。样品加样量的准确精度对实验的这一部分至关重要。

我们发现了问题后，联系了仪器厂家进行了重新维护和校准，也向北美的同事说明了具体原因。我们检查了这批实验，并重复了涉及这根钢针或不确定是否使用的数据，解决了这个数据误差，确保了实验的准确度。



### **你对未来五年的职业规划是什么？**


英文版本：
In the next five years, my career plan involves a continued dedication to innovation and development within the chemical industry. With my background in applied chemistry and current role as a Senior Formulation Chemist, I intend to further enhance my skills in both the traditional laboratory environment and big data analysis. My familiarity with Python and my ongoing studies in machine learning will drive me towards bridging the gap between conventional experimental work and data analytics.

I also see myself transitioning from my current position as a Senior Chemist to an Assistant Manager, learning and adapting to managerial responsibilities, including project and team management. My goal is to contribute more towards strategic planning, thinking logically and critically about projects, and making judgments aligned with the company's vision and mission.

In line with my passion for global collaboration, as demonstrated in my previous work in creating a surfactant HLD parameter library, I plan to further engage with international teams, fostering strong relationships and aligning efforts across multiple regions to enhance cooperation and achieve common goals.

在未来五年中，我的职业规划涉及继续致力于化学行业的创新和发展。凭借我在应用化学方面的背景和现在作为高级配方化学师的角色，我计划进一步增强在传统实验室环境和大数据分析方面的技能。我对Python的熟悉以及我正在学习的机器学习将推动我弥合传统实验工作与数据分析之间的鸿沟。

我还计划从现在的高级化学师职位转型为助理经理，学习和适应管理职责，包括项目和团队管理。我的目标是为战略规划贡献更多，对项目进行逻辑和批判性思考，并做出符合公司愿景和使命的判断。

与我对全球合作的热情相一致，正如我在之前创建表面活性剂HLD参数库的工作中所展示的，我计划进一步与国际团队互动，培育牢固的关系，并在多个地区协调努力，以增强合作和实现共同目标。



### 你怎么看待团队合作？请举一个与团队合作的实际例子。

英文版本： I view teamwork as an essential component of success in the professional environment, especially in the field of chemical formulation where collaboration is key. In a global setting like BASF, teamwork promotes innovation, efficiency, and ensures a harmonized approach across different regions.

An example of effective teamwork in my experience is a project I engaged in at BASF. We were working on optimizing surfactant formulations, and it required inputs from different departments and international teams, including North America. Through effective communication and collaboration, we were able to troubleshoot issues such as discrepancies in data matching. By collectively examining various factors like raw material purity, water pH, and hardness, and the density of different saline solutions, we uncovered an equipment malfunction. With shared insights and coordinated efforts, we resolved the issue, recalibrated the equipment, and ensured the accuracy of our experiments. This instance demonstrated the power of teamwork in solving complex problems and achieving shared goals.
