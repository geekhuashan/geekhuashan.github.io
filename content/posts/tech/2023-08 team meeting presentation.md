Hello, everyone! Good afternoon, I'm glad to have this opportunity to introduce my work to you.

My discussion today revolves around "High Throughput Formulation & Digitalization". I will be outlining two projects that highlight the use of high throughput and digitalization in our work.

## Page 2

High Throughput Formulation Technologies refer to a collection of advanced methods and equipment that facilitate the rapid and efficient preparation and analysis of various formulations.

Our high-throughput system has 45 channels and includes a central database that manages different raw materials and processes. Here's a simple overview of how the technology works:

1. **Powder Dosing**: Accurately dispenses diverse powders.
2. **Liquid Dosing**: Injects specific amounts of different liquids.
3. **Shaft Mixing/Homogenization**: Ensures complete sample mixing.
4. **pH Measurement**: Measures the pH level of the sample.
5. **Particle Sizer**: Assesses particle size distribution.
6. **Image Analyzer**: Examines compatibility, stability, transparency, turbidity, and foam height.
7. **Rheometer**: Tests sample rheology.

## Page 3

Let me introduce our workflow.

Usually we start with design experiments using DOE to meet the specific requirements of our project.

Next, we accurately weigh both solid and liquid materials using our HTT platform. To make sure everything mixes well, we employ various tools like stirring models and high-efficiency SpeedMixers.

Once all preparations are completed, we proceed to study the samples. This involves evaluating formulation properties like compatibility, stability, rheology, pH values particle size distribution etc. Additionally, we can also measure contact angle, surface tension as well if needed.

And then we will analyze the data by combining detailed information with the DOE method. The workflow allow us to deliver results that are high-quality, reliable, and repeatable.

The first project I will present is **Dispersion defoamer toolbox development.** In this project, we utilized High Throughput Formulation and Digitalization to address a common challenge in the production of ED dispersion - the formation of foam.

## Page 5

The main business of the ED department is to synthesize various dispersions for use in internal and external coatings, primers, and special applications.

The synthesis of these dispersions is a complex process. We use a combination of monomers, surfactants, initiators, and other additives to give the dispersion its unique properties. We might add a thickener to increase the viscosity, or a stabilizer to prevent separation.

But, like with any complex process, we face some issues. One big problem is foam. We need to use surfactants that cause the problem of the foam forming. 

It can really mess up our product's quality and slow down the product development. The final product might have issues like uneven coating or even breaking.

Our traditional solution to this problem has been the use of defoamers. They lower the surface tension and destabilize the foam, causing it to burst and disappear. However, the experiment process to select the right defoamer comes with its own set of problems.

## Page 6

In traditional defoamer experiment, we are dealing with large batches, typically 500g, which means high material consumption. The experiments are time-consuming, usually taking up to 1 to 1.5 hours for each test. And then there's the manual reading of the foam height, which introduces the potential for human error.

This picture was found online as a reference, but in ED's lab, it is even simpler than this one.

From our side, we want to develop a highly efficient, small scale and digital high throughput methodology on emulsion & defoamer screening to speed up ED's new product development, the benefits are:

- Remove bottleneck on time-consuming experiment
- Generate quick screening on Defoamer performance with different emulsions
- Provide quick feedback to synthesis for emulsion design
- Enables fast product development/optimization
- Build up a database with clean and systematic data for the better fundamental understanding

## Page 7

For this project, we have developed a new approach:

Step 1, the process of sample preparation is carried out utilizing the HTT Liquid Dosing Module, providing accuracy and precision.

Step 2, we engage the HTT Rheometer model for rheological testing. We apply different testing conditions according to the viscosity of the sample

Step 3: We generate foam using a shaker, carefully controlling the process to ensure accurate and repeatable results.

Step 4: Using the TransREM image system, we capture Remission, Scattered Light, and Transmission images of the foam, along with intensity plots.

## Page 8

Step 5: By using an intensity plot, we measure the original height before foaming and the total height of the sample after shaking. 

By subtracting these two values, we accurately determine the foam height. It's a simple but useful method that shows how we use pictures and plot data to find the exact height of the foam.

We will make three samples to ensure the repeatability and accuracy of the experiment.

## Page 9

Here are the results from our carefully designed workflow. By looking at these graphs, we can clearly see the impact of different defoamers on dispersions. 

And we can also easily measure how well different defoamers work by checking their foam height. We studied different combinations of dispersion and defoamers. 

We can clearly see the difference in their performance through images, digital plots, and precise readings.

This approach provides us with a comprehensive view and detailed understanding of the materials we are working with.

## Page 10

Comparing the traditional ED method and the HTT approach, our HTT approach can increase capacity, from 5 to 50 formulations per day; reduce batch size, from 500 gram to 10 gram, and provide digital output for foam analysis.

This is a novel method that improves the efficiency and accuracy of foam testing. This is also an ongoing topic with ED.

Used as a routine method by ED to

1) quickly screen different defoamers
2) used for dispersion product development and evaluation on Deforming performance
3) Working together with ED to build a database for ED dispersion defoamer toolbox development

The second project I will present is with EM - "HTT for DaBao SOD Milk resiliency formulation solution" 
resiliency  /rɪˈzɪliənsi/

## Page 12

Here is a recipe for DABAO. We have identified several key components, including their attributes, and the phases in which they are added. These include the water phase, an emulsifier known as Potassium Lauryl Phosphate, and the oil phase.
Potassium  /pəˈtæsiəm/    Lauryl   /ˈlɔːrɪl/   Phosphate /ˈfɒsfeɪt/

The key target is to replace the with the more suitable alternatives.

We are comparing our sample to the existing DaBao SOD Milk formula to ensure that the desired properties, such as sensory, physical features (pH and viscosity), Lumifuge stability, and 3 month aged stability, remain unchanged.

## Page 13

These are some candidate names for emulsifiers. The EM lab's task is to determine which two combinations of emulsifier are closest to Da Bao's standard sample. Our job is to create the HTT process and help them make the screening of emulsifier mixing ratios easier

## Page 14

Due to the limitations of our equipment in maintaining specific conditions required for the screening of emulsifiers, we had to change and re-developed the formulation process. We have made great efforts to develop a set of methods to overcome the difficulties encountered at each step. This let us make samples that are close to the ones made by the EM lab.

I won't go into details about every step we took.

## Page 15

Let me show you our final process, It covers the steps we've taken using High Throughput Technology to optimize the emulsification process. In this approach, we treated the oil and water phases separately before combining them.

For the water phase, we mixed anionic emulsifier (a powder) with other water phase components in a glass bottle, then placed it in a 75°C oven to dissolve fully.

Next, we added the oil phase using HTT liquid dosing and placed the samples in the preheated rack. Then remove the sample and place it in a 95°C water bath to reheat it. When the right temperature was reached, we stirred at 2000 RPM for 5 minutes, mixing thoroughly.

Finally, we slowly stirred as the temperature dropped to below 43°C, and then placed the mixture in a 25°C constant temperature incubator to form a crystal structure. This completed our preparation of the emulsion.

## Page 16
From the results of the Lumisizer stability evaluation and microscope photos, the sample Base 11, which was made according to the final process, is very close to the sample in the EM lab.

In this project, the HTT methodology we developed has reduced the time and resources needed to identify suitable emulsifiers.

## Page 17

Next Step
EM Lab will select the best combination of emulsifiers
HTT Lab will screen the mixing ratios of emulsifiers and identify the best candidates
Then EM will scale up the experiment by traditional preparation method for larger scale: 400 g/batch

In conclusion, these two projects demonstrate the value of high throughput and digitalization in accelerating product development, enhancing efficiency, and optimizing workflows.

By employing these advanced technologies, we can drive innovation, gain insights, and work faster and smarter. Thank you for your time today.
